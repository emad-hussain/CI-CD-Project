# CI-CD-Project
This GitHub repository is a java application for practicing CI/CD using jenkins pipeline. This pipeline performs tests using MAVEN at the code pulled from GitHub repository and then builds the whole code. The GitHub repository can be configured with Jenkins to trigger the action whenever a change is commited by developer but due to limitations for now it is working manually. Afterwards, the whole process is automated by Ansible and with the help of Docker Container apache tomcat webserver image is deployed to production and staging environment for running the application, later code is pushed to both production and staging servers. Lastly, projected is parameterized by built-in Jenkins functionality we can put latest build into action to either Production or Stagging.
